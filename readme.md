# Future of Drawing
Media design project with caran d'ache

# Process

Presented two prototypes linked to two different ideas: one of a interractive book used to incorporate your own drawings in your stories and procedurally animating them, and the other, more linked to my field research, an interactive table for playing role-play games. 
After the exchange with tutors and other students, I decided to merge my ideas and broadening the subject of IRL role-playing to the subject of talking, discussing and telling stories alone, or in groups.

Talked with the tutors about my idea of turning speech into personnal graphic language with new references and precised the formal and conceptuals questions I had to answer with testings and prototypes before continuing.

Made a prototype to help me testing some design ideas and activated it with pepole from the class. The testing helped me realize some of the fundamentals i had to have in mind for this project concering user experience and how the interraction must take place. I pused my research further concerning generative typography and graphic languages.
