After the briefing, I started the project with several ideas and guidelines in mind, I wanted to create an experience or an object that will allow people who don't usually draw or create visual art to make it more engaging and passive by using AI to transform things they already made or by using oral storytelling and transforming it into visuals or a playful way to do it. I then leaned into the field of role-playing games because it connected with my desire to turn oral "creations" and storytelling into something visual to show people who maybe don't normally draw how they can use their everyday language and ideas to make art.

Before I had the opportunity to do my field research and assist in a real roleplaying session, asking questions et ceaetera, I wanted to do a big roundup of all the already existing devices, objects, software, online roleplaying sessions, and forums on the internet that can help me see what are the points already explored, what is liked by the community, and what can be further explored. I made a big board collecting all this data and started writing down some insights about these areas of reaserch. this also helped me fine tune my questions for interviews and field reaserch to really point out the things I found interesting during this initial reaserch online.

I conducted my observation session in a roleplaying game, where I observed storytelling habits, game play behaviors, acceptance of change, and whether they used any kind of visual support. I also asked them a few questions about AI and related tools that I had learned about in my online research. The two main insights that came out of this were that they were quite reluctant to use AI to generate stories in order to keep their creative freedom, and that this area was already quite loaded with a lot of code and physical matter (dice, boards, accessories...). So I started to look for some ideas for objects that could either take place in this environment or in another area of oral storytelling.

I then presented two prototypes related to two different ideas: one was an interactive book, mainly for children, that could be used to incorporate one's own drawings into one's own stories, or into existing ones, and then procedurally animate them. The other, more related to my field research, an interactive table for role-playing games where the player could draw visual assets on tablets and then have them all added to a library that can be used by the table to procedurally generate landscape and visuals by listening to what the player says.

After interacting with tutors and other students, I decided to merge my ideas and expand the theme of IRL role-playing to include talking, discussing, and telling stories alone or in groups.

Talked with the tutors about my idea of creating an object or device that could transform speech and everyday storytelling into a library of generated personal graphic language. I presented new references linked to peapole creating new languages and written symbols in history aswell as some research on typography and visual pictograms. I then refined the formal and conceptual questions I needed to answer with tests and prototypes before proceeding.

Made a new prototype with a different scenari to help me testing design ideas and activated it with pepole from the class and friends. The testing helped me realize some of the fundamentals i had to have in mind for this project concering user experience and how the interraction must take place. I pushed my research further concerning generative typography and graphic languages.

Made some 3d visualisation mockups of the project to help me see how the final form can be and help think about the interraction a little more in depth. We talked about how the interraction with an external plateform may be confusing and put more weight on the project. So for now I decided to focus on the "pin" object and how it creates this identities based on speech.

We had a presentation with people from caran d'ache and the feedbacks were similar to what we said yesterday with Alexia and Douglas. I was told that the project have good bases and need to evolve in a more concise way, ableing it to be more precise and easy to understand.
